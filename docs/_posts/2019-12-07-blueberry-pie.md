## Supporting Recipes
* [Pastry Pie Crust](pastry-pie-crust) (double because this pie is topped)

## Ingredients
* 6 cups (890g) fresh blueberries
* ⅔ cup (135g) granulated sugar
* ¼ cup (28g) cornstarch
* ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter, chopped
* 1 large egg
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) milk

### Optional
* coarse sugar for garnish

## Steps
1.  Prepare the [pastry crust](pastry-pie-crust), but do not bake it. Make a second dough disc and set aside.
2.  Stir blueberries, granulated sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and lemon juice together in a large bowl.
3.  Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).
4.  Spoon filling into the uncooked crust. Leave excess liquid behind. Dot the top of the filling with the pieces of butter.
5.  Roll out the second dough disc to about 12 inches and use a pastry wheel or pizza cutter to create strips 1-2 inches wide.
6.  Weave the dough strips over the top of the pie (over and under alternating strips). Trim off excess.
7.  Lightly beat egg and milk together.
8.  Lightly brush the top pie crust with egg/milk mixture. Sprinkle the top with coarse sugar.
9.  Place the pie onto a large baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes. Keeping the pie in the oven, turn the temperature down to 350°F (177°C) and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes. After the first 20 minutes of bake time, add a pie crust shield on top of the pie to prevent the edges from browning too quickly.
10. Allow the pie to cool for 3 full hours at room temperature before serving. This time allows the filling to thicken up. Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
