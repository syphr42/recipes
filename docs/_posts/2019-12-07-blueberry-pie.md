## Supporting Recipes
* [Pastry Pie Crust](pastry-pie-crust) (double because this pie is topped)

## Ingredients
* 6 cups (900g or 2lbs) fresh blueberries
* ⅔ cup (135g) granulated sugar
* ¼ cup (31g) unbleached all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons (14g) cornstarch
* ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest
* 1 tablespoon (14g) cold unsalted butter
* 1 large egg
* 1 tablespoon (15ml) milk

### Optional
* coarse sugar for garnish

## Steps
1.  Prepare the [pastry crust](pastry-pie-crust), but do not bake it. Make a second dough disc and set aside.
2.  Stir blueberries, sugar, flour, cornstarch, cinnamon, lemon juice, and lemon zest together in a large bowl. Make sure there are no dry, powery bits left (hint: break a few blueberries to help mix it).
3.  Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C) with the rack in the lower third.
4.  Spoon filling into the uncooked crust. Leave excess liquid behind. Dot the top of the filling with small pieces of butter.
5.  Roll out the second dough disc to about 12 inches and use a pastry wheel or pizza cutter to create strips 1-2 inches wide.
6.  Weave the dough strips over the top of the pie (over and under alternating strips). Trim off excess and crimp the edges.
7.  Lightly beat egg and milk together.
8.  Lightly brush the top pie crust with egg/milk mixture.
9.  **Optional:** Sprinkle the top with coarse sugar.
10. Place the pie onto a large baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes.
11. Turn the temperature down to 375°F (190°C).
12. Keeping the pie in the oven, cover the edges to protect the crust (aluminum foil or a silicone shield).
13. Bake for an additional 40-50 minutes. The filling should be bubbling at close to 200°F (93°C). Keep an eye on the crust to prevent over-cooking it. If necessary, remove the shield around the edges and put a loose aluminum foil tent over the pie to protect the top.
14. Allow the pie to cool for 4 hours at room temperature before serving. This time allows the filling to thicken up. Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
