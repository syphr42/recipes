## Supporting Recipes
* [Pastry Pie Crust](pastry-pie-crust)

## Ingredients

### Filling
* 3 egg yolks
* 1½ cups sugar
* ⅓ cup plus 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 1½ cups water
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 2 teaspoons grated lemon zest
* ½ cup lemon juice

* ½ teaspoon vanilla

## Steps

### Filling
1.  Preheat oven to 350°F.
2.  In small bowl, beat egg yolks with fork.
3.  In 2-quart saucepan, mix sugar and the cornstarch; gradually stir in water.
4.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and boils. Boil and stir 1 minute.

### Meringue
8.  In medium bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar with electric mixer on high speed until foamy.
9.  Beat in sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time; scrape side of bowl occasionally. Continue beating until stiff, glossy peaks form and sugar is completely dissolved.
10. Beat in vanilla.

### Finish
11. Pour hot lemon filling into [baked pie crust](pastry-pie-crust).
12. Immediately drop spoonfuls of meringue onto hot lemon filling and carefully spread meringue to cover top completely, spreading to edge of crust to prevent shrinkage or weeping.
13. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until meringue is browned and temperature reaches 160°F.
14. Cool on cooling rack 1 hour.
15. Refrigerate about 4 hours or until filling is set. Store loosely covered in refrigerator.
