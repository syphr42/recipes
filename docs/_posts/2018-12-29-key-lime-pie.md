## Supporting Recipes
* [Graham Cracker Pie Crust](graham-cracker-pie-crust)
* [Whipped Cream](whipped-cream)

## Ingredients
* 1½ tablespoons zest from key limes, divided
* 3 egg yolks
* 14 oz sweetened and condensed milk
* ¾ cup key lime juice (from approximately 1 pound of key limes)

## Steps
1.  Whip most of the zest (reserving a pinch for sprinkling the top of the pie to garnish) and egg yolks in a large mixing bowl for 2 minutes or until thickened.
2.  Add sweetened and condensed milk and mix for 3 minutes or until thickened.
3.  Add lime juice and mix until combined.
4.  Pour mixture into [pie crust](graham-cracker-pie-crust).
5.  Place in oven for 15 minutes. Pie will rise slightly but the filling won't change color.
6.  Allow to cool for ½ hour at room temperature before cooling completely in the fridge for at least 2 hours. You can also place it in the freezer instead of the fridge to cool it quicker. Just remember to remove it before it turns into ice cream!
7.  Top with [whipped cream](whipped-cream) and remaining lime zest.
