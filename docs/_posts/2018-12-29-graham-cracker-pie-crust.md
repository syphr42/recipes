## Ingredients
* 5 tablespoons (65 ml) butter
* 2 cups (480 ml) graham cracker crumbs (9 full graham crackers)
* ¼ cup (60 ml) sugar
* ¼ teaspoon (1.25 ml) sea salt

## Steps
1.  Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2.  Melt the butter (about 60 seconds in the microwave on high).
3.  Crush the graham crackers into a rough powder. You can use a food processor, but it is a lot more fun to put the graham crackers in a sealable bag and smash them. I use a rubber mallet.
4.  Mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and salt until combined in a medium-large mixing bowl.
5.  Add butter to the mixture and stir until combined.
6.  Put the mixture into a 9-inch pie dish and pat it down with your fingers or a metal spoon to make the crust. Start with the walls and then push the remainder into the bottom.
7.  Bake for 10 minutes or until very lightly browned.
8.  Allow to cool.
