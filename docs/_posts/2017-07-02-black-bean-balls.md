## Ingredients
*   15 oz. Black Beans (1 can)
*   1 cup Oat Flour (oats ground up)
*   1 cup Rolled Oats
*   Bread Crumbs (optional)
*   Oil (optional, if you fry them)
*   1 1/2 tbsp Flax Seeds (ground)
*   1 1/2 tsp Salt
*   1 tsp Smoked Paprika
*   1 tsp Garlic powder
*   1 tsp Onion powder

## Steps
1.  Heat a medium-sized skillet to medium-high heat or preheat your oven to 425 degrees F (options for frying or baking, your choice).
2.  In a food processor pulse oats & flax seeds (if whole, not ground) till slightly chunky powder. Set aside in a medium bowl.
3.  Drain your black beans and rinse till water runs clear, fill your can back up with water (with the beans still in the can) and pour it all into your food processor. Pulse till smooth.
4.  Combine your rolled oats (blended and regular), bean pur√©e and seasonings till fully incorporated, let rest for 5 minutes to thicken.
5.  Portion out 1 in. scoop balls and roll in bread crumbs for an even coat. Fry about 2-3 minutes on each side, rotating/flipping every couple minutes till dark golden brown all over. Or bake for 6-8 minutes, flip and repeat.
