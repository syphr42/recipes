## Ingredients
* 1 medium pie/sugar pumpkin (approx. 3 lbs)
* Canola oil

## Steps
1.  Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
2.  Remove the stem from the pumpkin and scrape out the insides. You can discard the seeds or bake them for a delicious snack.
3.  Cut the pumpkin in half and lay the pieces cut-side down on a rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil.
4.  Rub canola oil all over the skin.
5.  Bake until fork-tender (about 1 hour). Let cool.
6.  Scoop out the pulp from the roasted pumpkin and puree in a food processor until smooth (you should have about 4 cups).
